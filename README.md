# Set

A few javascript snippets for drawing out set cards on html5 canvases. 
Everything is in index.html, for now.

## Why?

I thought it might be fun to flash three card trios at participants (familiar with the game),
and ask them if the three are a valid set or not. The point would be to see if people are
better/faster when the three differ only in one dimension (color, shape, shading, number),
and if there is a preferred dimension to differ on. My guess is that people kind of get in a groove
of looking for the 1-2-3's of all different dimensions, or maybe one dimension the same. 

Haven't found participants yet through.

## Experiment B

Also, I'll start showing players feedback about the choices they make (valid/invalid set),
but not let them go back to double-check for themselves. There'll be a clock, and they'll be
rushing. Would, then, lying to them about their answers make them a) play slower, b) be 
frustrated, or c) have no effect?

Basically I just need a little bit of an extension to allow for experiment design, and then
a backend to collect answers (coming soon, at formious.com).

### Credits

Almost forgot! Wouldn't have been possible without the absolutely awesome .ai output plugin 
by [these guys: MIX Online Lab](http://visitmix.com/labs/ai2canvas/). I will be definitely
using your tool in other projects.
